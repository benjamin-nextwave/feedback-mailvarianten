### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Single account, no user management (small team, keeps auth simple)
- Client sees read-only view after submission (prevents confusion)
- Fire-and-forget webhook (don't block UX on external service reliability)
